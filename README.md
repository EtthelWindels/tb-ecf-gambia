# Estimating the effect of enhanced case finding on TB transmission using phylodynamics

This repository contains XML files associated with the phylodynamic analyses performed in "The impact of enhanced-case-finding on tuberculosis incidence and transmission in The Gambia: a cluster randomized trial" (in prep)

These analyses aimed at estimating the effect of enhanced case finding on TB transmission using *Mtb* genomes collected during a cluster randomized trial in The Gambia (2012-2014).

The raw sequencing data used in this study are available under project accession number [PRJEB53138](https://www.ebi.ac.uk/ena/browser/view/PRJEB53138).
